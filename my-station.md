My station is still very much on the light side. The base comprises of an
Kenwood TS-130s, used for 10 Meters connected to an I-Max 2000 antenna. Hopefully
soon I'll be able to use all of it's bands. As well as a
Uniden 760xlt Scanner. It's not much, but it's home :).

Most of my 2m/440 time is spent mobile on a [Lexien VV-898E](/2020/07/review-leixen-vv-898e-25w-vhf-uhf-radio/), or portable on a
Baofeng UV-82HP. I'm hoping over time as I grow in ham radio my station will
grow with me to 'bigger' and 'better' radios.

### Base Station Radios

**Radios!** Left to right: Lenovo T430 (temporary station laptop), behind the laptop is my Uniden 710 CB,
Astatic Tri-Window SWR/Power/Modulation meter, Pyrmid PS25G, Cheap Weather Station, Kenwood TS-130s, D104 Station Mic.

My Man Cave/Ham Shack/Home Office (other side of basement) is still under construction, so here sit's the temp shack.
This setup is much more tolerable than a month ago, which was setup on a small peice of wood. I suppose it could be worse...

### Base Station Antennas

**Imax2000**: This is the photo right after it went up. It's still in the same place, however better mast mounting
and a disconnect box, with lightning arrestor has been installed. Super easy to bring down if needed
for maintenance or weather.

More antennas comming soon!

### Mobile Station (KC1MJP Rover 1)

**2014 Ford Focus** Not the best of rovers, but she'll do for now.

**Antennas** The important one is on the right, Tram 1181 - 1/4 on 2m and 5/8 on 440.

**Radios!** I did originally install the [Lexien VV-898E](/2020/07/review-leixen-vv-898e-25w-vhf-uhf-radio/)
a bit cleaner than this, but I was tired of looking down to change things while underway (not to mention it's unsafe!).
This is where it'll sit until it's replaced.
