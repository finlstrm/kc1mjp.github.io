My station is still very much on the light side. The base comprises of an
RCI-2990, used for 10 Meters connected to an I-Max 2000 antenna. As well as a
Uniden 760xlt Scanner. It's not much, but it's home :).

Most of my 2m/440 time is spent mobile on a [Lexien VV-898E](/2020/07/review-leixen-vv-898e-25w-vhf-uhf-radio/), or portable on a
Baofeng UV-82HP. I'm hoping over time as I grow in ham radio my station will
grow with me to 'bigger' and 'better' radios.
