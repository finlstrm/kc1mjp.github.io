Hi!! And welcome to my (other) little slice of the web.

My name is Michael J. Ford, and this is where you'll find my projects and ramblings about
Amateur (Ham) Radio. I just recently became licensed on 23 DEC 2019 as KC1MJP and looking
forward to all that Ham Radio has to offer. I got my start (as many of us have) on CB Radio,
FRS Radio - but I wanted more, and now trying to figure out where to start.

Here I'd like to share things I find partularly interesting in the Ham Radio world, and maybe
show off a few custom projects as well. Stay tuned!!!

By day, I'm a Linux Systems Engineer, Cyber Security professional, and Linux/FLOSS Advocate,
currently working in Defense. You can see that stuff at [slashetc.us](https://www.slashetc.us).
