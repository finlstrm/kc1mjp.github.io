# National 2 Meter "*Calling*" Frequency: 146.52

Let's talk about it.

I monitor 146.52 daily, via scanner in the shack or on the 'B' band of my
mobile rig, and I constantly hear ragchews on what is supposed to be a '*calling*' frequency. What
gives! Is it that hard to QSY to another open simplex channel (there's 18 of them in the
[NESMC](https://www.nesmc.org/) band plan). To be honest, this practice really discourages
monitoring, because sometimes you don't care to listen to that QSO and/or you're too far to
participate. About 99% of the time, I simply turn off the scanner, or turn the dial while mobile -
but what's the point of a '*calling*' frequency at that point (not to mention it makes the sticker
on my car a lie).

Not everyone is looking for a ragchew either. Sometimes locals like to monitor for new guy in town
or someone who's just passing through, looking for a quick bit of informaiton and doesn't know the
local repeater frequencies, or.. you might find yourself to be that new guy or just passing through
from time to time. If .52 is tied up with a long QSO, by the time that person (or yourself) has a
chance to key up, they may no longer be in the area or the question they were going to ask is now
OBE.

Below is from the Summer 2006 issue of [CQ VHF](http://www.cq-vhf.com/) by
[K0NR](http://www.k0nr.com/blog/2008/02/use-of-14652-mhz.html), and I couldn't agree more..

I find the '*Three Minute Rule*' to be one of the best approaches I've found - the problem now becomes
getting the locals to agree. Let's all try to adopt this and keep the frequency open for everyone,
and for the purpose it was intended. I'd also recommend to program the simplex frequencies in your
radios, listed below, which will make it that much easier to QSY.
