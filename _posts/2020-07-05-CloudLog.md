Logging contacts is one of the things we Amateur Radio types do. Some do it on paper (the old school way),
and others using one (or a few) applications/programs from a variety of sources - some paid, some free (as in beer),
and some free (as in speech). Myself, I use a combination thereof. I usually do the initial logging in a notebook, then
transfer it into an app on my phone later, but that's only on my phone. So I went out on a search for something that I
can 1. self host, 2. is web based, 3. has a nice API, and 4. is free (as in speech). I found all of that and more in
CloudLog. I let the readme (below) and links speak for themselfs below, however, the one thing I did notice is that
there is no clients available for this, mostly for offline use and sync - at least not yet.
